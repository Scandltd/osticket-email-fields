## Notes
There was a bug [#4287](https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/issues/4287). As result, standard fields can not be replaced by email values.

The bug was fixed, but your version may contain old code. If you are unable to update your sources, you can manually modify the code to fix this bug.

Сhange the send() function in /include/class.signal.php file as below:
```
static function send($signal, $object, &$data=null) {
    if (!isset(self::$subscribers[$signal]))
        return;
    foreach (self::$subscribers[$signal] as $sub) {
        list($s, $callable, $check) = $sub;
        if ($s && !is_a($object, $s))
            continue;
        elseif ($check && !call_user_func_array($check, array($object, $data)))
            continue;
        call_user_func_array($callable, array($object, &$data));
    }
}
```
